## Summary

Briefly summarize the overall goal of the project, the main challenges addressed, and key outcomes from formulation development.

## Introduction

Provide background information on the drug/compound, its properties, therapeutic relevance, the experiment itself, for example. Mention any formulation challenges and rationale for the study.

## Objectives

List the key objectives of the project. Number the objectives or use concise paragraphs.

## Methodology

Explain the formulation approach including but no limited to:
- Computational excipient prediction (if applicable)
- Solvent solubility screening methodology
- Formulation preparation steps
- Analytical characterization techniques (e.g., HPLC, microscopy, turbidity)
- Emulsion optimization strategy

Go into great detail and include tables, images, or graphs where applicable.

## Results

Summarize key experimental findings, these may include (but not limited to):
- Best solvents or excipient combinations
- Observed solubility and stability outcomes
- Interpretation of HPLC/microscopy data (described textually)
- Comparisons across formulation batches
- Challenges encountered and solutions attempted

Break into sub-sections if multiple experiments/cohorts were tested.

Go into great detail and include tables, images, or graphs where applicable.


## Conclusion

Conclude with:
- Overall assessment of successful and failed strategies
- Recommendations for the next steps
- Future directions (e.g., transdermal potential, scale-up feasibility, further modeling)

Highlight the most promising formulation(s) and explain why.
